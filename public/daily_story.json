  "story": "In the heart of the forest, a wild boar named Bertha loved to dance. She'd spin and twirl, her tusks glinting in the sunlight, as she grooved to the chirping birds and rustling leaves. Bertha's love of dance brought joy to all the forest creatures, who'd gather 'round to watch her perform. One day, a young fawn wandered into the forest and stumbled upon Bertha's dance party. Enchanted, the fawn joined in, and Bertha welcomed her with a warm snout-nuzzle. Together, they created a spectacle of movement and music, bringing laughter and cheer to the forest. As the sun dipped low, Bertha and her new friend danced off into the trees, ready for their next adventure.",
