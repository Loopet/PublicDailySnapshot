  "story": "In a lush forest, a tiny topi named Tiko loved to dance under the bright sunshine. She wore a tiny tutu and a bright smile, her green leaves swaying to the rhythm of her footsteps. One day, a group of ants stumbled upon Tiko's dance party and couldn't help but join in. Before long, a parade of critters marched by, each one adding their own unique move to the routine. A rabbit twirled, a bird tapped its beak, and even a squirrel kicked its paws. The forest came alive with laughter and joy, all thanks to Tiko's infectious enthusiasm. As the sun set, the parade concluded with a final, triumphant bow. Tiko beamed, knowing she'd brought the forest together in a celebration of fun and friendship.",
