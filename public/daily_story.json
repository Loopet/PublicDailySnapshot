  "story": "In the kelp forests of the Pacific, a playful sea otter named Ollie lived life to the fullest. She loved to frolic in the waves, chasing schools of fish and playing hide-and-seek among the seaweed. One sunny day, Ollie stumbled upon a lost seashell blown by the wind. She grasped it tightly, twirling and whirling, and before long, she'd created a makeshift hat. The other sea creatures couldn't help but giggle at her silly getup. As the sun set, Ollie settled into her cozy den, her seashell hat still nestled on her fur, feeling grateful for the joy she'd brought to her friends and the special treasure she'd discovered.",
