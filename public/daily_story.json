  "story": "In the rolling hills of the countryside, a lovable water buffalo named Bubbles lived on a sun-kissed farm. With a coat as white as freshly fallen snow and a moo that could charm the birds from the trees, Bubbles was the belle of the farm. She loved nothing more than spending her days splashing in the muddy pond and making her friends laugh with her silly antics. One afternoon, a group of children on a farm tour stumbled upon Bubbles taking a nap in the shade. They giggled at her snorting snores and decided to join her for a picnic. Together, they laughed, played, and made memories that would last a lifetime.",
