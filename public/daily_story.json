  "story": "Winston the wombat loved to dance! Every full moon, he'd slip out of his cozy burrow and boogie under the stars. His favorite move was the wombat wiggle, a twirl of his fluffy tail and a wiggle of his whiskers. As he spun across the meadow, the other animals couldn't help but join in. Together, they formed a joyful jumble of furry friends, bouncing and bobbing to the lunar beat. Winston beamed with pride, his belly shaking like a drum. And when the moon dipped below the horizon, the party remained, still pulsing with the rhythm of friendship and fun.",
