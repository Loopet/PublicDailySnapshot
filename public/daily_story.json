  "story": "Percy the Vulture was a peculiar bird. While his fellow vultures scavenged for scraps, Percy had a sweet tooth. He'd swoop down on picnics, eyes shining with excitement, to snag a chunk of juicy watermelon or a sprinkled cookie. The humans would laugh and shoo him away, but Percy's antics brought joy to all who saw him. One day, a little boy lost his favorite toy on a hillside. Percy spotted it and gently dropped it at the boy's feet. The youngster's eyes lit up, and he hugged Percy, exclaiming, \"You're the kindest vulture ever!\" From then on, Percy was dubbed the \"Vulture of Delight\" and his picnicking escapades became the stuff of legend.",
