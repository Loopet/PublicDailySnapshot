  "story": "In the lush Philippine rainforest, a tiny tarsier named Timmy woke up to the sweetest of melodies â€“ the chirping of his favorite songbird, Lola. Timmy's giant eyes sparkled with excitement as he stretched his long, fluffy tail and scampered out of his cozy treehouse. He danced under the starry night sky, his pointed nose twitching to the rhythm, until he reached Lola's nest. The songbird greeted him with a trill, and together, they harmonized in perfect pitch. As the moon rose high, their impromptu concert attracted other forest friends, and soon the night air was filled with joyful voices and laughter. Timmy beamed with pride, knowing he'd brought happiness to his forest family.",
