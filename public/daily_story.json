  "story": "In the sun-drenched meadow, a curious stoat named Felix spotted a fluttering butterfly. Entranced, he followed the iridescent wings to a hidden clearing. Among the wildflowers, Felix discovered a secret garden, where the butterfly, named Luna, lived among the petals. Luna welcomed Felix and taught him the joy of collecting nectar and making flower crowns. As they played, the meadow's creatures gathered to dance and sing around the stoat and butterfly duo. The garden sparkled with magic, filling Felix with wonder and Felix with friendship. From that day on, the meadow's denizens celebrated the stoat and butterfly duo, who brought sunshine and whimsy to their little corner of the world.",
