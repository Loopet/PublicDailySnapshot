  "story": "Once upon a time, in a sunny beach town, a little sand dollar named Dolly lived a simple life. She spent her days buried in the sand, filtering food and enjoying the gentle ocean breezes. One day, a curious child named Lily discovered Dolly and gently picked her up. As Lily held Dolly, she felt a sense of calm and happiness wash over her. Dolly began to glow with a soft blue light, and Lily felt magic in the air. With Dolly as her guide, Lily discovered hidden treasures on the beach, like shells and shiny pebbles. Together, they reveled in the joy of exploring and connection. As the sun set, Lily returned Dolly to the sand, promising to visit her again soon.",
