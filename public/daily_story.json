  "story": "In the heart of Tasmania, a mischievous devil named Delilah loved to play pranks on her friends. One sunny day, she stole a batch of freshly baked scones from the local bakery and hid them in her treetop lair. As the townsfolk searched high and low for the missing treats, Delilah watched from above, giggling with glee.\n\nJust as she was about to devour the loot, a group of curious kids stumbled upon her lair. Delilah's grin widened as they devoured the scones alongside her, laughing and making new friends. From that day on, Delilah's antics were met with smiling faces, and her legendary baking heists became the stuff of local legend.",
