  "story": "In the heart of the African savannah, a little rhinoceros named Rosie loved to dance. She'd spin and twirl, her ears flapping wildly, as she moved to the beat of the birds singing in the trees. One day, Rosie decided to host a party for all her animal friends. She cleared a path through the grass and set up a makeshift disco ball made of shiny leaves. The animals arrived, laughing and grooving to Rosie's infectious beat. Together, they danced the day away, under the warm sun, with their trunks and claws tapping out the rhythm. As the party came to a close, Rosie beamed with joy, knowing she'd brought a little extra happiness to the savannah.",
