  "story": "In the sun-kissed Arctic, Wally the walrus was known for his joyful tusk-taps and harmonious humming. One day, a group of playful penguins stumbled upon Wally's underwater concert hall. Enchanted by his talent, they begged him to jam with them. Wally happily obliged, his tusks tapping out a lively beat as the penguins waddled, waved, and flapped along. Together, they created an unforgettable aquatic orchestra. As the impromptu performance ended, the group of friends shared a hearty \"Wheeee!\" of laughter, their joy echoing across the icy tundra. From that day on, Wally's underwater concert hall became the go-to spot for inter-species jam sessions.",
