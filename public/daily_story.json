  "story": "In a sunny meadow, a little toad named Croaky lived a life of pure joy. With a croak of excitement, he'd bounce from blade to blade, releasing tiny puffs of cloud-like spores with each jump. As he played, the wildflowers surrounding him began to bloom, their petals dancing in rhythm with Croaky's bouncy steps. A gentle breeze carried the sweet scent of fresh flowers, and bees buzzed with delight, joining the toad's impromptu dance party. Together, they spun a whirlwind of magic, spreading happiness throughout the meadow. And Croaky, the tiny, spore- releasing toad, was the master of ceremonies, spreading joy to all who lived and played beneath the sunny sky.",
