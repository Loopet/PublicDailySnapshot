  "story": "Percy the Woodpecker was a bird of bright blue and red feathers, with a beak as red as a stop sign. He loved to drum on trees, creating a rhythmic beat that echoed through the forest. One day, a group of rabbits stumbled upon Percy's drum solo and were mesmerized. They started tapping their paws and dancing along, creating a joyful forest party. Percy's drumming grew more vibrant and energetic, and soon a squirrel, a fox, and even a deer joined in. Together, they created a symphony of sounds, filling the forest with laughter and warmth. And Percy, the little woodpecker, felt his heart sing with happiness.",
