  "story": "In the vibrant waters of Coral Bay, a charming stingray named Finley made his home. With a heart as bright as the sun and a smile as wide as the sea, Finley loved nothing more than bringing joy to his friends. One day, he discovered a lost little fish named Luna, alone and frightened in the kelp forests. Finley swooped in, his wing-like fins gliding effortlessly, and guided Luna back to her school. The fish thanked Finley with a song, their harmonious voices echoing through the waves. From that day on, Finley was known as the bay's unofficial ambassador of joy, spreading love and positivity throughout the ocean.",
