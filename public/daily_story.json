  "story": "In a lush, prehistoric meadow, a woolly mammoth named Max wandered with a gentle gait, his tusks glinting in the sunlight. As he munched on juicy clover, he stumbled upon a group of playful saber-toothed kittens, chasing each other with joyful yowls. Max's trunk curled into a smile as he joined the fun, using his tusks to gently redirect the kittens' playfulness. Together, they frolicked, creating a symphony of laughter and trumpeting moos. As the sun began to set, Max lay down, surrounded by the kittens, who snuggled up close, purring contentedly. In this peaceful scene, magic filled the air, and the mammoth's heart swelled with happiness.",
