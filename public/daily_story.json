  "story": "As the sun rose over the ocean, a sea turtle named Finley poked her head out of the waves. She stretched her flippers and yawned, releasing a tiny bubble that floated away. Finley loved starting her day with a swim to her secret garden, a hidden coral reef filled with colorful fish and sea anemones.\n\nAs she swam, she sang a little song: \"Good morning, ocean! Good morning, me!\" She twirled and dived, her shell glistening in the sunlight. Finley danced through the reef, leaving a trail of bubbles behind. As she surfaced, she grinned, feeling the joy of being alive in the beautiful ocean.",
