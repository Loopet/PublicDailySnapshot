  "story": "In the vibrant ocean, a starfish named Stella shone bright. She loved to dance under the coral reef's twinkling lights, her five arms wiggling to the rhythm of the waves. One day, a school of fish asked Stella to join their underwater party. She happily agreed and twirled among the sea anemones, her starry spots sparkling like diamonds. The fish cheered and clapped, mesmerized by Stella's joyful rhythm. Together, they created a magical spectacle, filling the ocean with laughter and light. From that day on, Stella was known as the starfish with the sparkliest dance moves in the sea.",
