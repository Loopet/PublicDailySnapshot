  "story": "Once upon a time, in a forest full of fluffy trees, a little sable named Squeaky lived. She loved to play hide-and-seek with her friends, but they always found her because she was wearing her brightest, most sparkly fur. One day, while trying to hide, Squeaky stumbled upon a shiny rainbow-colored rock. She picked it up and declared, \"I'm the rainbow rock queen!\" From that day on, whenever she hid, she'd hold the rock and make the forest sparkle with magic. Her friends would search and search, but she'd whisper \"Shhh, it's sparkly!\" and they'd laugh together, knowing the rock took them on a treasure hunt to find Squeaky, the most sparkly sable in the forest.",
