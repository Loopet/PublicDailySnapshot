  "story": "In the warm, golden soil, a small but mighty worm named Wiggles lived. She loved to burrow through the dirt, creating tunnels and pathways for her fellow worms to follow. One day, Wiggles discovered a tiny acorn hidden beneath the earth. Excited, she brought it back to her underground village and shared it with her friends. They celebrated with a worm-wide party, dancing and wiggling their bodies in joy. As they feasted, Wiggles realized that even the smallest gifts could bring the greatest happiness. From then on, she and her friends explored the soil, spreading joy and harmony wherever they went.",
