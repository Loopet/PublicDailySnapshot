  "story": "As the sun rose over the sandy shore, a little sandpiper named Sally stretched her wings and yawned. She loved being a sandpiper â€“ who wouldn't want to spend their days flitting between the waves and playing in the warm sand? Sally's best friend, a seagull named Sam, joined her on the beach and they chased each other in a game of tag. They laughed and chirped, enjoying the gentle breeze and salty air. As the tide came in, Sally and Sam settled down to watch the waves roll in, feeling grateful for their carefree life by the sea. It was the perfect day to be a sandpiper!",
